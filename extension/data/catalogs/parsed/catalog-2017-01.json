Students will work through activities \nthat enhance their learning and understanding of the physical assessment. These include learning about the importance of the health history, working \nthrough the body systems through readings, case studies, and virtual simulations.  Interviewing and advance history taking are an integral part of the \nassessment process along with the skills to complete a primary physical assessment. Students will master these assessment competencies through \nthe use of virtual simulation reality experiences as well as demonstrating their competency in all aspects of physical assessment.  This course is \ntaught in tandem with the Caring Arts and Sciences Across the Lifespan Part 1 course."

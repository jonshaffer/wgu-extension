The M.S. in Special Education includes content knowledge related to teaching special education K-12 as well as research, instructional design, and performance improvement. The M.S. in Special education program also includes two Capstone experiences: 1) a 240-hour in-class supervised teaching practicum: MS SPED Teacher Work Sample Written Project/Practicum I and 2) the MS SPED Teacher Work Sample Oral Defense/Practicum II which provide students with opportunities for practical application at advanced levels in special education classrooms. The most important aspect of this program is that it provides an avenue for professionals currently engaged in a teaching career, whose content and pedagogy backgrounds are significant, to serve in our country's elementary, middle, and high schools by teaching in special education in grades K-12. In order to matriculate into the M.S. Special Education degree, students must have a valid teaching certificate and be highly qualified as defined by the \"Highly Qualified Teachers\" component of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act.

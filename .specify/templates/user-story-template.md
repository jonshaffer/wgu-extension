## Template Usage Guidelines

1. **Start with the user**: Always begin with the user's perspective and needs
2. **Be specific**: Vague requirements lead to misunderstandings
3. **Include examples**: Concrete examples help clarify abstract requirements
4. **Consider edge cases**: Think about what could go wrong or unusual scenarios
5. **Keep it focused**: Each story should represent a single, coherent piece of functionality
6. **Make it testable**: Acceptance criteria should be specific enough to guide testing

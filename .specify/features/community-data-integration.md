# Community Data Integration Specification

## Purpose

Enable WGU students to discover and access community resources (Discord servers, Reddit communities, study groups) directly from their course pages and through integrated search functionality.

## User Problems Addressed

### Primary Problems
1. **Resource Discovery**: Students struggle to find relevant study groups and communities for their courses
2. **Information Scatter**: Community resources are spread across multiple platforms with no central discovery
3. **Context Switching**: Students must leave WGU platform to find course-specific help
4. **Quality Assessment**: Difficult to determine which communities are active and helpful

### Secondary Problems
1. **Privacy Concerns**: Students want to explore communities without exposing personal information
2. **Platform Fragmentation**: Different communities use different platforms (Discord, Reddit, WGU Connect)
3. **Outdated Information**: Community links and member counts become stale

## User Stories

### As a WGU Student
- I want to see relevant communities when viewing a course page
- I want to search for communities by course code or topic
- I want to understand community activity levels before joining
- I want to access communities without sharing my personal information
- I want to find both official and unofficial study resources

### As a Community Moderator
- I want my community to be discoverable by relevant students
- I want accurate member counts and activity indicators displayed
- I want clear attribution when my community is featured

### As a Privacy-Conscious User
- I want to browse communities without tracking
- I want transparent information about data collection
- I want to know what information is stored about communities

## Functional Requirements

### Data Collection
1. **Multi-Platform Support**: Collect data from Discord, Reddit, WGU Connect, and student groups
2. **Public Data Only**: Extract only publicly available information (server names, member counts, descriptions)
3. **Automated Updates**: Refresh community data through automated processes
4. **Quality Validation**: Validate data accuracy and format before storage

### Data Processing
1. **Course Mapping**: Associate communities with relevant course codes
2. **Metadata Enrichment**: Add activity indicators, member counts, and verification status
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and handle duplicate communities across platforms
4. **Content Filtering**: Ensure appropriate content standards for student audience

### Data Storage
1. **Structured Database**: Store community data in Firestore with proper indexing
2. **GraphQL API**: Provide type-safe access to community data
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement client-side caching for performance
4. **Version Control**: Track changes to community data over time

### Data Access
1. **Search Interface**: Enable text-based search across all community types
2. **Course Integration**: Display relevant communities on course pages
3. **Filtering Options**: Allow filtering by platform, activity level, and member count
4. **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure data access works on mobile devices

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Community search results in < 500ms
- Course page enhancement loads in < 200ms
- Support for 10,000+ communities without degradation
- Graceful degradation when external APIs are unavailable

### Privacy
- No personal data collection from students
- No tracking of student browsing behavior
- Clear data source attribution
- Option to report outdated or inappropriate communities

### Reliability
- 99% uptime for community data access
- Automatic fallback to cached data when APIs fail
- Data consistency across all access points
- Regular data validation and cleanup

### Security
- Input validation for all external data
- Rate limiting on data collection APIs
- Secure storage of API credentials
- Protection against malicious community data

## Integration Points

### Browser Extension
- Content script injection on WGU course pages
- Search panel overlay with community results
- Storage of user preferences and cache data

### Firebase Backend
- GraphQL API for community data queries
- Firestore database for structured storage
- Cloud Functions for data processing and ingestion

### External APIs
- Discord API for server metadata
- Reddit API for subreddit information
- WGU Connect for official study groups
- Student group platforms for community data

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Number of community resources accessed per student
- Time spent exploring communities through extension
- Student feedback on resource relevance and quality

### Data Quality
- Accuracy of community information (member counts, activity)
- Freshness of data (last updated timestamps)
- Coverage of WGU courses with community resources

### Performance
- Search response times
- Extension load times
- API reliability and uptime

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Real-time community activity indicators
- User-contributed community suggestions
- Community rating and review system

### Phase 3
- Integration with WGU learning management system
- Personalized community recommendations
- Community event calendar integration

## Dependencies

### External
- Discord API access and rate limits
- Reddit API terms of service compliance
- WGU Connect data availability
- Student group platform cooperation

### Internal
- GraphQL API infrastructure
- Extension content script framework
- Data validation and processing pipeline
- User interface component library

## Risks and Mitigations

### Data Privacy
- **Risk**: Accidental collection of personal data
- **Mitigation**: Strict data validation schemas and regular audits

### Platform Changes
- **Risk**: External API changes breaking data collection
- **Mitigation**: Versioned adapters and fallback strategies

### Data Quality
- **Risk**: Outdated or inaccurate community information
- **Mitigation**: Automated validation and user reporting system

### Performance
- **Risk**: Large dataset affecting search performance
- **Mitigation**: Proper indexing, caching, and query optimization

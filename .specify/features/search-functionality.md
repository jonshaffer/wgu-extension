# Search Functionality Specification

## Purpose

Provide comprehensive search capabilities across all community resources, courses, and study materials to help WGU students quickly find relevant information and connect with learning communities.

## User Problems Addressed

### Primary Problems
1. **Information Fragmentation**: Resources scattered across multiple platforms without unified search
2. **Discovery Difficulty**: Students can't easily find communities or resources relevant to their courses
3. **Search Inefficiency**: Multiple searches required across different platforms to find comprehensive information
4. **Context Loss**: Search results lack context about relevance to current course or study goals

### Secondary Problems
1. **Mobile Search**: Existing search interfaces poorly optimized for mobile devices
2. **Search History**: No way to revisit previous searches or bookmark useful results
3. **Result Quality**: Difficulty determining which results are most relevant or up-to-date
4. **Search Scope**: Unclear what data sources are being searched

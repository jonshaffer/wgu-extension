# Course Enhancement Specification

## Purpose

Enhance WGU course pages with additional resources, community links, and study materials to improve student learning outcomes and course engagement.

## User Problems Addressed

### Primary Problems
1. **Limited Resources**: Official course pages lack comprehensive study materials and community resources
2. **Context Switching**: Students must navigate away from course pages to find additional help
3. **Resource Discovery**: Difficulty finding course-specific study aids and community discussions
4. **Information Overload**: Too much scattered information without clear organization

### Secondary Problems
1. **Mobile Experience**: Course enhancements must work on mobile devices
2. **Page Performance**: Additional features shouldn't slow down course page loading
3. **Visual Integration**: Enhancements should feel native to WGU's design system
4. **Accessibility**: All enhancements must be accessible to students with disabilities

## User Stories

- I want to see relevant study communities when viewing a course page
- I want quick access to course-specific Discord servers and Reddit discussions
- I want to find study guides and resources shared by other students
- I want to see course statistics and completion rates
- I want all enhancements to load quickly and not interfere with official content

### As a Mobile Student
- I want course enhancements to work on my phone and tablet
- I want touch-friendly interfaces for community links
- I want responsive layouts that adapt to my screen size

### As an Accessibility User
- I want all enhancement features to work with screen readers

## Functional Requirements

### Community Resources Panel
1. **Resource Display**: Show relevant Discord servers, Reddit communities, and study groups
2. **Activity Indicators**: Display member counts and activity levels
3. **Quick Access**: One-click links to join or visit communities
4. **Filtering Options**: Filter resources by type (Discord, Reddit, WGU Connect)

### Course Information Enhancement
1. **Extended Metadata**: Show additional course information (competency units, prerequisites)
2. **Statistics**: Display course completion rates and difficulty ratings
3. **Related Courses**: Suggest related or prerequisite courses
4. **Study Resources**: Link to external study materials and guides

### Search Integration
1. **In-Page Search**: Search for course-specific resources without leaving the page
2. **Global Search**: Access to university-wide resource search
3. **Quick Filters**: Rapidly filter results by resource type or topic
4. **Search History**: Remember recent searches for quick access

### User Interface Enhancements
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show additional information on demand
2. **Collapsible Panels**: Allow students to minimize enhancement panels
3. **Theme Integration**: Match WGU's visual design and color scheme
4. **Loading States**: Provide feedback during data loading

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Enhancement panels load in < 300ms after course page load
- No impact on original page load time
- Smooth animations and transitions (60fps)
- Efficient memory usage on resource-constrained devices

### Visual Design
- Seamless integration with existing WGU design
- Consistent typography and spacing
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- High contrast mode support

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all enhancement features
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for modal dialogs

### Reliability
- Graceful degradation when community data is unavailable
- Fallback to cached data during network issues
- Error handling that doesn't break the original page
- Recovery from failed API calls

## Integration Points

### WGU Course Pages
- Content script injection into course pages
- DOM manipulation to add enhancement panels
- Event handling for user interactions
- Storage of user preferences

### Extension Background
- Communication with background script for data fetching
- Cross-tab synchronization of user settings
- Badge updates for course-related notifications

### GraphQL API
- Queries for course-specific community resources
- Search functionality for additional resources
- Caching of frequently accessed data

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Page Load
1. Course page loads normally
2. Extension content script detects course page
3. Course code extracted from page content
4. Enhancement panel injected with loading state
5. Community data fetched and displayed

### User Interaction
1. Student clicks on community resource
2. External link opens in new tab (preserving original page)
3. Visit tracked for analytics (without personal data)
4. Success/error feedback provided to user

### Search Experience
1. Student opens search panel
2. Real-time search suggestions appear
3. Results filtered by course relevance
4. Quick access to detailed resource information

## Success Metrics

### Engagement
- Percentage of course page visits that use enhancements
- Number of community resources accessed per course visit
- Time spent interacting with enhancement features

### Performance
- Page load impact (should be < 50ms additional)
- Enhancement load times
- User satisfaction with performance

### Accessibility
- Screen reader compatibility testing results
- Keyboard navigation completion rates
- High contrast mode usage

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Limitations
- Content script restrictions on DOM access
- Cross-origin request limitations
- Storage quota limits for cached data

### WGU Platform
- Must not interfere with official functionality
- Should handle WGU design system changes gracefully
- Must respect WGU's terms of service

### Performance Budgets
- Maximum 100KB additional resources per page
- No more than 2 additional HTTP requests
- Memory usage under 50MB per tab

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Course progress tracking visualization
- Study group scheduling integration
- Note-taking and annotation features

### Phase 3
- AI-powered study recommendations
- Collaborative study session coordination
- Integration with WGU mobile app

## Dependencies

### External
- WGU course page structure and URLs
- Community data availability from GraphQL API
- Browser extension API capabilities

### Internal
- Extension content script framework
- GraphQL client library
- UI component library
- User preference management system

## Risks and Mitigations

### WGU Platform Changes
- **Risk**: WGU updates breaking enhancement injection
- **Mitigation**: Robust DOM querying and fallback strategies

### Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Enhancements slowing down course pages
- **Mitigation**: Lazy loading, efficient caching, and performance monitoring

### User Experience
- **Risk**: Enhancements feeling intrusive or overwhelming
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, user controls, and preference settings

### Accessibility
- **Risk**: Enhancements not working with assistive technologies
- **Mitigation**: Regular accessibility testing and compliance validation

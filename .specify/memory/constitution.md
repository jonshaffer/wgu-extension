# WGU Extension Project Constitution

## Mission Statement

The WGU Extension exists to enhance the educational experience of Western Governors University students by providing easy access to community resources, study groups, and collaborative learning opportunities through a privacy-respecting browser extension.

## Core Principles

### 1. Student Privacy First
- **No Personal Data Collection**: We collect only public community information
- **Minimal Permissions**: Extension requests only necessary browser permissions for WGU domains
- **Transparent Data Usage**: All data sources and processing are documented and open-source
- **Security by Design**: Implement Content Security Policy, secure storage, and input sanitization

### 2. Code Quality Standards

#### TypeScript Excellence
- **Strict Mode Required**: All TypeScript must use strict compiler settings
- **Explicit Types**: No `any` types; prefer specific interfaces and union types
- **Type Safety**: Types must flow from backend → GraphQL client → consumers
- **Runtime Validation**: Use Zod schemas for data validation at boundaries

#### React Development
- **Functional Components**: Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract business logic into reusable custom hooks
- **Performance**: Minimize re-renders through proper memoization and dependency arrays
- **Accessibility**: All UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

#### Testing Requirements
- **Data Validation**: All data schemas must have validation tests
- **Manual Testing**: Extension features require browser testing with dev builds
- **Integration Tests**: Firebase Functions require emulator testing
- **Type Checking**: All code must pass TypeScript strict mode compilation

### 3. User Experience Consistency

#### Design System
- **Radix UI Primitives**: Use Radix UI for accessible, unstyled components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilize Tailwind for consistent styling across all interfaces
- **Design Tokens**: Maintain consistent colors, spacing, and typography
- **Responsive Design**: All interfaces must work on mobile and desktop

#### Information Architecture
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Surface most relevant information first
- **Clear Navigation**: Users should always know where they are and how to get back
- **Loading States**: Provide feedback during data fetching and processing
- **Error Handling**: Display helpful error messages with recovery actions

### 4. Performance Standards

#### Bundle Optimization
- **Extension Size**: Keep extension bundle under 5MB for fast loading
- **Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports for non-critical functionality
- **Asset Optimization**: Compress images and minimize static assets
- **GraphQL Efficiency**: Use persisted queries and client-side caching

#### Data Processing
- **Streaming**: Process large data files in streams to avoid memory issues
- **Batch Operations**: Group database operations to minimize round trips
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently accessed data with appropriate TTL
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect external API limits and implement graceful degradation

### 5. Security Requirements

#### Extension Security
- **Content Security Policy**: Enforce strict CSP in manifest.json
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs and external data
- **Storage Isolation**: Use extension storage APIs, never web storage
- **Origin Validation**: Verify data sources and reject untrusted content

#### API Security  
- **Authentication**: Secure admin functions with proper authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling on all endpoints
- **Data Validation**: Validate all inputs against schemas
- **Error Disclosure**: Never expose internal system details in error messages

### 6. Development Workflow

#### Monorepo Standards
- **Workspace Isolation**: Each workspace must be independently buildable
- **Shared Types**: Use npm packages for type sharing between workspaces
- **Cross-Workspace Scripts**: Coordinate builds and deployments through root package.json
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and minimize duplication

#### Git Practices
- **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit format for automated releases
- **Feature Branches**: Develop features in isolated branches
- **Pull Request Reviews**: All changes require review before merging
- **Automated Testing**: CI must pass before merge approval

#### Documentation Standards
- **Specification-First**: Create feature specifications before implementation
- **Living Documentation**: Keep documentation current with code changes
- **AI Agent Instructions**: Maintain clear CLAUDE.md files for AI assistance
- **API Documentation**: Document all endpoints and GraphQL schemas

## Technical Decision Making

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Research Phase**: Analyze existing patterns and external best practices
2. **Specification**: Document the "what" and "why" before the "how"
3. **Prototyping**: Build minimal viable implementation to validate approach
4. **Review**: Team review of both specification and implementation
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs and share learnings

### Technology Adoption
- **Proven Technologies**: Prefer established, well-documented technologies
- **Bundle Impact**: Consider size and performance impact of new dependencies
- **Maintenance Burden**: Evaluate long-term maintenance requirements
- **Community Support**: Choose technologies with active communities

### Breaking Changes
- **Migration Path**: Always provide clear upgrade path for breaking changes
- **Deprecation Period**: Give users time to adapt to changes
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility when possible
- **Communication**: Clearly communicate changes and timelines

## Quality Gates

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning Culture
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document and share technical discoveries
- **Post-Mortems**: Learn from issues without blame
- **Experimentation**: Encourage trying new approaches in non-critical areas
- **Feedback Integration**: Actively seek and incorporate user feedback

### Technical Debt Management
- **Regular Audits**: Quarterly review of technical debt
- **Incremental Improvement**: Address tech debt in regular development cycles
- **Refactoring Budget**: Allocate time for code quality improvements
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies current and secure

## Enforcement

This constitution guides all technical decisions. When in doubt:

1. **Consult this document** for established principles
2. **Discuss with team** for interpretation questions
3. **Update constitution** if new patterns emerge
4. **Document decisions** to help future contributors

The constitution evolves with the project but changes require team consensus and clear justification.

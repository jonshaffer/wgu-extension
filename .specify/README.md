# WGU Extension Specifications

This directory contains specifications following [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) principles for intent-driven development.

## Directory Structure

### `/memory/`
Contains foundational documents that establish project principles and standards:

- **[constitution.md](memory/constitution.md)** - Project governing principles, coding standards, and decision-making processes

### `/features/`
Contains detailed specifications for major project features:

- **[community-data-integration.md](features/community-data-integration.md)** - Community resource discovery and integration
- **[course-enhancement.md](features/course-enhancement.md)** - WGU course page enhancement features  
- **[search-functionality.md](features/search-functionality.md)** - Cross-platform search capabilities
- **[data-processing-pipeline.md](features/data-processing-pipeline.md)** - Automated data collection and processing

### `/templates/`
Contains templates for creating consistent documentation:

- **[feature-specification-template.md](templates/feature-specification-template.md)** - Template for new feature specifications
- **[technical-decision-record-template.md](templates/technical-decision-record-template.md)** - Template for architectural decisions
- **[user-story-template.md](templates/user-story-template.md)** - Template for user story documentation

## Using These Specifications

### For New Features
1. Start by reviewing the [constitution](memory/constitution.md) for established principles
2. Check existing [feature specifications](features/) for related functionality
3. Create a new specification using the [feature template](templates/feature-specification-template.md)
4. Focus on user needs and business value before implementation details

### For Technical Decisions
1. Use the [technical decision record template](templates/technical-decision-record-template.md)
2. Document the problem, options considered, and rationale for the chosen solution
3. Include implementation plans and success criteria

### For User Stories
1. Use the [user story template](templates/user-story-template.md)
2. Include acceptance criteria and testing approaches
3. Link to relevant feature specifications

## Spec Kit Principles

### Intent-Driven Development
- Specifications focus on "what" and "why" before "how"
- User needs and business value drive technical decisions
- Implementation details are separate from specifications

### Multi-Step Refinement
1. **Establish Principles** - Define project constitution and standards
2. **Create Specifications** - Document feature requirements and user needs
3. **Plan Implementation** - Design technical solutions based on specifications
4. **Execute Development** - Build according to plans and specifications

### AI-Model Compatibility
- Specifications are written to be easily understood by AI coding assistants
- Clear structure and explicit requirements reduce ambiguity
- Templates ensure consistency across all documentation

## Maintaining Specifications

### When to Update
- User needs change or evolve
- New technical constraints are discovered
- Feature requirements expand or change scope
- Implementation reveals specification gaps

### Review Process
1. Specifications should be reviewed before major implementation changes
2. Updates require the same rigor as the original specification
3. Changes should be documented with rationale
4. Related specifications should be updated for consistency

### Version Control
- Specifications are versioned with the code
- Changes are tracked through Git history
- Breaking changes to specifications should be clearly marked

## Getting Started

If you're new to this project:

1. **Read the [constitution](memory/constitution.md)** to understand project principles
2. **Review relevant [feature specifications](features/)** for the area you're working on
3. **Use the [templates](templates/)** when creating new documentation
4. **Ask questions** if specifications are unclear or incomplete

The goal is to make development more predictable and consistent by clearly documenting intent before implementation.

import { initializeDiscordCollection } from './collect/content-script-integration.js';

// Auto-initialize in content script
const collector = initializeDiscordCollection();
```

### Manual Processing
Run the ingestion script to process existing raw Discord data:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/ingest-discord.ts
```

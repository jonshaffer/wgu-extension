The course is \ndesigned to provide students with a thorough understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including the interdependent operational relationships \namong them. Students will use a dissection lab to study organ systems of the human body in their healthy state including the digestive, skeletal, \nsensory, respiratory, reproductive, nervous, muscular, cardiovascular, lymphatic, integumentary, endocrine and renal systems. By examining these \norgan systems in a healthy state, healthcare professionals are more adept to recognize when a something is functioning abnormally, which is a key \ncomponent to providing effective care to patients. For nursing students this is the first of two anatomy and physiology courses within the program of \nstudy. This course has no pre-requisites.",

You will then \nimplement (i.e., teach) the unit in your classroom and gather data as to its effectiveness.\nC\u0017\u0013\u0018 - BIO 2011 - Anatomy and Physiology II - Anatomy and Physiology II continues the examination of the human body systems first introduced in \nAnatomy and Physiology I. This course invites students to take a deeper look into the terminology, structure, function and interdependent operational \nrelationships of human body systems. Students will continue their study of the nervous, muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, digestive, \nendocrine, and reproductive systems. Additional topics include basic cell processes, metabolic functioning, the hematologic system, immunity and \nprinciples of thermoregulation. Labs allow the student to explore organ systems and their physiological processes. In addition to these labs, students \nare also given the opportunity to complete a hands–on fetal pig dissection. For nursing students this is the second of two anatomy and physiology \ncourses within the program of study. All students needed to have completed Anatomy and Physiology I in addition to English Composition I and II as \npre-requisites to this course.\n© Western Governors University  1/10/17165",

The course also encourages students to consider the influence of language, perception, culture, and media on their \ndaily communicative interactions. In addition to theory, students will engage in the application of effective communication skills through systematically \npreparing and delivering an oral presentation.  By practicing these fundamental skills in human communication, students become more competent \ncommunicators as they develop more flexible, useful, and discriminatory communicative practices in a variety of contexts.",

The Institute of Medicine \nreports that cited medication errors as the most common medical errors, costing billions of dollars and harming up to 1.5 million people every year. \nMedication errors are often the result of nurses failing to follow proper procedures. The pharmacology course covers the following concepts: the \nnursing process in relation to drug therapy; the role of pharmacological principles in nursing; the role of the nurse in pharmacy and lifespan \nconsiderations; cultural, ethical, and legal considerations; education and substance abuse; and gene therapy and pharmacology. This course \nintroduces the nursing student to these concepts and continues to integrate pharmacology throughout the clinical courses within the program.",

Students will work through activities \nthat enhance their learning and understanding of the physical assessment. These include learning about the importance of the health history, working \nthrough the body systems through readings, case studies, and virtual simulations.  Interviewing and advance history taking are an integral part of the \nassessment process along with the skills to complete a primary physical assessment. Students will master these assessment competencies through \nthe use of virtual simulation reality experiences as well as demonstrating their competency in all aspects of physical assessment.  This course is \ntaught in tandem with the Caring Arts and Sciences Across the Lifespan Part 1 course.",

This seminar begins with a quick tour of discovery and exploration in physics, from the ancient Greek philosophers on to Galileo Galilei, \nIsaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Einstein’s work then serves as the departure point for a detailed look at the properties of motion, time, space, \nmatter, and energy. The course considers Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, his photon hypothesis, wave-particle duality, his General Theory of \nRelativity and its implications for astrophysics and cosmology, as well as his three-decade quest for a unified field theory. It also looks at Einstein as a \nsocial and political figure, and his contributions as a social and political force. Scientist-authored essays, online interaction, videos, and web resources \nenable learners to trace this historic path of discovery and explore implications of technology for society, energy production in stars, black holes, the \nBig Ban",

This seminar begins with a quick tour of discovery and exploration in physics, from the ancient Greek philosophers on to Galileo Galilei, \nIsaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Einstein’s work then serves as the departure point for a detailed look at the properties of motion, time, space, \nmatter, and energy. The course considers Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, his photon hypothesis, wave-particle duality, his General Theory of \nRelativity and its implications for astrophysics and cosmology, as well as his three-decade quest for a unified field theory. It also looks at Einstein as a \nsocial and political figure, and his contributions as a social and political force. Scientist-authored essays, online interaction, videos, and web resources \nenable learners to trace this historic path of discovery and explore implications of technology for society, energy production in stars, black holes, the \nBig Ban",

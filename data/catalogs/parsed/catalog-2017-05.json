      "description": "The Bachelor of Arts in Special Education (K-12), Cross-Categorical Model, is a competency-based program that enables teacher candidates to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Special Education (BASP) degree and leads to an initial dual licensure in Special Education (K-12) and Elementary Education (K-8) teaching certificate online (except for the in- classroom component Demonstration Teaching and options for in-classroom field experiences prior to Demonstration Teaching). This program consists of four balanced areas of study (domains), competency-based assessments, and the creation of a professional portfolio. It includes a supervised teaching practicum that consists of two placements, one in an elementary classroom and one in a middle or secondary level classroom. Both placements should support the academic needs of students with mild-to-moderate disabilities. The Special Education Cross-Categorical Model is a specifically designed program for the education and training of prospective teachers to work with students with mild/moderate disabilities in a variety of school settings, including inclusionary K-12 classrooms, resource rooms or selfcontained classrooms; serve as teacher of record K-8, as well as teach all basic school subjects in the elementary education classroom. With the successful completion of required assessments in the major area of teaching, the student can receive institutional recommendation for certification in special education and in elementary education. During the required major or sequence of the standard path, students gain knowledge, skills, and competencies essential to effective teaching while being involved in field-based experiences.

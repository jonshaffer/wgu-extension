      "description": "The Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education (BAELED) is a competency-based degree program that prepares students with the competencies needed to apply for licensure as an elementary educator. This program consists of online courses which take the learner from general education through educational professional core coursework, continuing through methods of elementary instruction and assessment, including inclusive practices for students with mild to moderate exceptionalities. Candidates develop and refine their teaching skills through a series of sequential experiences beginning with video-based observations and simulations of classroom instruction to prepare candidates for authentic, collaborative, clinical teaching experiences in elementary settings. Clinical experiences include teaching in face-to-face environments and culminate with supervised student teaching in a real classroom. With the successful completion of degree requirements for graduation, including required assessments in the major area of teaching, the student can receive institutional recommendation for licensure in elementary education.

The Special Education, Mild to Moderate Exceptionalities program is specifically designed for the preparation of prospective teachers to work with students with mild to moderate disabilities in a variety of educational settings, including inclusion K-12 classrooms and resource classrooms. This program consists of online courses which take the learner from general education through educational professional core coursework, continuing with specialized courses for special education content and methods of instruction, assessment, and progress monitoring. Candidates develop and refine their teaching skills through a series of sequential experiences beginning with video-based observations and simulations of classroom instruction to prepare candidates for authentic, collaborative, clinical teaching experiences in P-12 special education settings. Multiple clinical experiences include teaching in face-to-face environments and culminate with supervised student teaching in two authentic classroom placements, one in an elementary special education setting and another in a secondary special education setting. Both placements support the academic needs of students seeking a license across all P-12 grades with mild-to-moderate disabilities. With the successful completion of degree requirements for graduation, including required assessments in the major area of teaching, the student can receive institutional recommendation for licensure in special education.

Candidates develop and refine their teaching skills through a series of sequential experiences beginning with video- based observations of classroom instruction. Observations prepare candidates for an authentic, collaborative preclinical teaching experiences in K-12 settings. Clinical experiences culminate with supervised demonstration teaching in a real classroom. This program focuses on e.",
